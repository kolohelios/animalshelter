I would definitely ordinarily use multiple JS files to make a project more modular though this project seems relatively well-served with a single JS file. I also used "eslint" though I removed my linting file prior to packaging this up. It's the same one I used for the Node.JS side except it includes Angular as a global.

I did not use a template system to generate the HTML file; it is all hand-coded. I usually use Jade or Middleman, as well as a pre-processor for the CSS (of which there is none). I generally also don't use CDNs as I have here unless it's a small-scale personal project.

There are comments in both the .html and .js files.
